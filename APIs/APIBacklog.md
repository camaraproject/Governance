| Localization / Geofencing | CRA: User <br></br> MAPE: MA ||||||
| Device status | CRA: User <br></br> MAPE: MA | TEF | It provides the customer with the ability to receive information about device status.<br></br>*NOTE 1: The customer can explicitly query for this information (request-response mode) or be reported with notifications on subscribed events (subscribe-notify mode)*.<br></br>*NOTE 2: Examples of this info include e.g., location tracking (UE location and cell site), USIM change,  no. devices present in an area (RA, TA, cell), device mobility info (intra-TA handover, inter-TA handover),  CN type change (5G to 4G, viceversa), roaming status, device reachability (e.g. for SMS delivery)*.| NEF (Rel-15, M)| Short-term | HIGH | 1 |
| Network status | CRA: User <br></br> MAPE: MA | TEF | It provides the customer with the ability to receive information about network status.<br></br>*NOTE 1: The customer can explicitly query for this information (request-response mode) or be reported with notifications on subscribed events (subscribe-notify mode)*.<br></br>*NOTE 2: Examples of this info include e.g., network connectivity type (no connectivity, 4G, 5G, ..),  performance measurements (e.g. UL/throughput, latency, jitter, packet loss rate, etc.), fault events (e.g. network congestions, node failure).* <br></br>*NOTE 3: Performance measurements and fault events can be provided at network node (function) level,  network domain (slice subnet) or end-to-end (slice) level*. | <ul><li>NEF (Rel-15, M): for raw exposure on 5GC info.</li><li>NWDAF (Rel-16, O): data aggregation capabilities (combination, transformation and correlation of raw data) to provide performance measurements and fault events at 5GC (slice)  subnet levels. Without NWDAF, only NF level data is available for  exposure via NEF</li><li>RIC (O-RAN, O): availability of xApps/rApps for analytics at RAN (slice) subnet level.</li><li>SDTN (IETF/TIP, O): alarm/event collection (using NETCONF/YANG) and telemetry collection (using NETCONF/YANG or gRPC) on underlay WAN nodes. </li></ul>. |Short-term for 5GC (w/o NWDAF).<br></br>Medium-term for RAN (w/ RAN)<br></br>Long-term for TN (w/ SDTN).| HIGH | 1 |
| Edge Discovery | CRA: User <br></br> MAPE: MA | TEF | It provides the customer with the ability to:<ul><li>Discover the set of edge nodes available in a certain region, where the customer can deploy edge applications</li><li>discover the set of edge nodes in a certain region where a certain API functionality is available (and thus the customer edge application can make use of it). </li></ul>*NOTE: Applicable at provisioning time. Note that there can be a mode in which the customer does not know about the actual edge nodes and can just ask for the deployment of an edge app to cover a certain region (the provider decides which edge nodes will be needed)*.<br></br><ul><li>request the edge service instance to connect to for a certain user/device, based on its location and app requirements. This includes edge application discovery (mandatory) and edge application relocation (optional, in mobility scenarios for service contuinity support).</li></ul>*NOTE: Applicable at operation time*. | <ul><li>Edge application discovery (Rel-15, M): the application client is connected to the optimal edge node, one which runs instances of the application, has the necessary resources (CPU, GPU, etc.) and provides max guaranteed latency.<br></br>*NOTE: There are two options for edge application discovery, namely DNS based (3GPP SA2 solution) and device based (3GPP SA6 solution).<br></br>*</li><li>Edge application relocation (Rel-16, O): in mobility scenarios, there is a need for context migration (seamless transfer the context from a stateful application instance in an edge node to an instance of the same application in a target edge node).</li><li>NEF (Rel-15, M): application instance behaves as an AF.</li><li>PCF (Rel-15, M):re-route traffic towards the most suitable edge node. </li></ul>. | Short-term for edge application discovery.<br></br>Medium-term for edge application relocation.| HIGH | 1 |
| Traffic Influence | CRA: User <br></br> MAPE: E | TEF, TIM |It provides the customer with the ability to modify the connection policies of UEs and applications in terms of how the traffic flows (QoS and routing).<br></br>*NOTE 2: wrt QoS, the customer can request for a specific 5QI on the session*.<br></br>*NOTE 1: wrt routing, the customer can specify the edge node towards which traffic shall be routed*. | <ul><li>NEF (Rel-15, M)</li><li>UDM (Rel-15, M)</li></ul> | Medium-term | HIGH | 2 |
